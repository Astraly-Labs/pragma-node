# Pragma Node ðŸ§©

This repository contains the source code of the Pragma Node, which comprises several services and libraries:

- **Pragma Node**: Service for querying and storing data.
- **Pragma Ingestor**: Service running to ingest data from Data Sources.
- **Pragma Common**: Library containing common models and functions.
- **Pragma Entities**: Library containing models/Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and functions for entities.
- **Pragma Offchain Service**: Offchain service aggregating and storing data from Data Providers.

# Services description

### Pragma Node

The Pragma Node service allows querying and storing data within the Pragma database. It retrieves, verifies, and sends data to the Kafka service. It also provides the ability to query data stored in the database.

### Pragma Ingestor

This service listens on the Kafka service and stores the retrieved data in the database. It performs certain checks on the collected data.

### Pragma Common

This library contains the models and functions common to different services.

### Pragma Entities

This library contains models and DTOs related to the entities used in the services and Pragma's database.
